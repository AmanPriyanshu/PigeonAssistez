## Inspiration
When we first heard about the theme of the hackathon, "Let's kickstart 2023 by building productivity tools," we desired to build a product that creates an indelible impact in people's lives. As we started brainstorming, we kept returning to the idea of a chatbot that could help schedule appointments. We all know how frustrating it can be to try and coordinate schedules with other people, especially when trying to book a meeting or an appointment. Delving deeper into the idea, we realized the vast scope this had.

That's when we stumbled upon Courier's fast-paced API. It gave us the freedom to explore beyond just the limited vision of project stage updation or work-hours computation. We could now leverage its timely attributes to explore avenues that would help both the individual and the corporation. Our chatbot not only schedules appointments but also sends notifications and reminders to ensure that people never miss a meeting again.

The thought of making people's lives easier by sending notifications and reminders for meetings and appointments through individual emails for personal appointments and a slack channel integration for team meetings, syncs, or stand-ups, made us excited. We also realized that this could be an excellent tool for companies, as it would keep their employees organized and on schedule. And so, we set out to create something that would make a real difference in people's lives.

## Our Tools 
Our project is built using a combination of different technologies and frameworks. The backend stack is built with Spacy, NLTK POS tagging, and intent extractor, which provides us with state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities. This allows the chatbot to infer meeting timings from notes and schedule appointments with ease. The frontend stack is built with Streamlit, which allows for a smooth and easy-to-use demonstration of the application. We also integrated the chatbot with Courier's API to provide timely notifications and reminders.

The project was developed with a focus on user-centered design and testing at each stage of development. The development process was divided into several stages, starting with the design of the chatbot's interface and the development of its backend capabilities, followed by the integration of the chatbot with Courier's API, and finally, the testing and deployment of the application.

The project is written in Python, with a focus on using libraries and frameworks like NLTK and Spacy to handle natural language processing and the integration of Courier's API.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of the main accomplishments that we are proud of is the potential impact that our project has on productivity and organization. The chatbot's ability to schedule appointments and send notifications and reminders through individual emails and slack channels can help individuals and teams stay on schedule and never miss a meeting again. This can save time and increase efficiency for both individuals and corporations. Additionally, the chatbot's natural language processing capabilities make it easy to use and understand, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we ran into during the development of the project was the integration of our date-time parser. We encountered issues with compatibility between the semantic understanding and scheduling charges. However, despite this setback, our team was able to overcome this challenge and successfully add a parser to create a powerful natural language processing capability for the chatbot.

## What we learned
Some of the key takeaways from developing this project was our newfound love for schedule allocation systems. We learned a lot about the Courier API and especially designing its beautiful notifications!

## What's next for PigeonAssistez

We aim to expand PigeonAssistez to allow access to notes and handwriting manuals to allow people the liberty to schedule appointments scribbled on paper. We also plan to create an API of the same in the future, which can be integrated into every social messaging platform to ensure ease in scheduling appointments.
